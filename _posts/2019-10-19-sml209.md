This term I have a great group of students on undergraduate module 'SML209: Computers and Languages'. We've been learning to make small websites using GitHub pages. This is a great way for them to learn and for me to teach. Here's my tutorial site so far: [HTML Tutorials](https://martinbarge.github.io/sml5202-19-Teach/). I have high hopes for this year's group.

### Update (2023)

Since this initial post, we have made use of Bootstrap to construct our own template files, to make use of the power of GitHub pages to generate templated pages, and to utilise Bootstrap's extensive range of libraries and classes. The 2022 iteration of the site is at [Bootstrap with GitHub pages](https://martinbarge.github.io/sml5202-2022-JaneSmith/index.html)
